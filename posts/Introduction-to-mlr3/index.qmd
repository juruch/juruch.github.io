In this blog I aim to explain what I understand from re-doing [the following tutorial.](https://tdhock.github.io/blog/2025/mlr3torch-conv/)

## Introduction

## Loading the dataset

Before starting the tutorial I had to create a seperate file to download the csv file that was needed.

In a file that I called Download.R :

```{r, eval=FALSE}
other.name.vec <- c("EMNIST", "FashionMNIST")
data.name.vec <- c(other.name.vec, "MNIST")

prefix <- "https://rcdata.nau.edu/genomic-ml/cv-same-other-paper/data_Classif/"
data_Classif <- "~/data_Classif"
options(timeout = 600)#seconds
for(data.name in data.name.vec){
  data.csv <- paste0(data.name, ".csv")
  local.csv <- file.path(data_Classif, data.csv)
  if(!file.exists(local.csv)){
    remote.csv <- paste0(prefix, data.csv)
    download.file(remote.csv, local.csv)
  }
}
```

This code will create a new folder called data_Classif in which you'll find the files :

-   EMNIST.csv

-   FashionMNIST.csv

-   MNIST.csv
